// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
int led = 13;

// Setup routine runs once when you press reset:

void setup() {
    // initialize the digital pin as an output.
    pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// Loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(1000);               // Wait for a second
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1000);               // Wait for a second
